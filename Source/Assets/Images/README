# Assets Guide

This game supports custom sprites and backgrounds to enhance visuals.

## Directory Structure

```
assets/
├── sprites/          # Station, train, and rider sprites
└── backgrounds/      # Background images
```

## Adding Sprites

### Station Sprites
Place PNG images in `assets/sprites/` with these names:
- `station_circle.png` - Circle station
- `station_triangle.png` - Triangle station
- `station_square.png` - Square station
- `station_cross.png` - Cross station
- `station_pentagon.png` - Pentagon station
- `station_hexagon.png` - Hexagon station

**Recommended size:** 40x40 pixels (will be scaled automatically)

### Train Sprites
Place PNG images in `assets/sprites/` with these names:
- `train_regular.png` - Regular train
- `train_express.png` - Express train
- `train_highcap.png` - High capacity train

**Recommended size:** 24x24 pixels (will be scaled automatically)

### Rider Sprites
Place PNG images in `assets/sprites/` with these names:
- `rider_circle.png` - Rider going to circle station
- `rider_triangle.png` - Rider going to triangle station
- `rider_square.png` - Rider going to square station
- `rider_cross.png` - Rider going to cross station
- `rider_pentagon.png` - Rider going to pentagon station
- `rider_hexagon.png` - Rider going to hexagon station

**Recommended size:** 10x10 pixels (will be scaled automatically)

## Adding Background

Place any image in `assets/backgrounds/` and load it programmatically:

```python
from resources import resources

# In your main.py or minimetro.py initialization
resources.load_background("your_background.png")
```

**Recommended size:** 800x800 pixels (matches game window)

## Fallback Behavior

If sprites are not found, the game will automatically fall back to geometric shapes:
- Stations: Colored geometric shapes (circle, triangle, square, etc.)
- Trains: Colored rectangles
- Riders: Small geometric shapes matching their destination
- Background: Solid color (#0E0E0E)

## Supported Formats

- **Images:** PNG (recommended), JPG, GIF
- **Transparency:** PNG with alpha channel supported
- **Color modes:** RGB, RGBA

## Tips

1. **Use transparent PNGs** for stations and trains to look better over backgrounds
2. **Keep file sizes small** (<100KB per sprite) for better performance
3. **Use consistent art style** across all sprites
4. **Test with and without sprites** to ensure fallback works

## Example Workflow

1. Create your sprites in your favorite image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, Aseprite, etc.)
2. Export as PNG with transparency
3. Save to appropriate `assets/sprites/` folder with correct naming
4. Run the game - sprites will load automatically!

## Creating Simple Sprites

Quick start using Python/PIL:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

# Create a simple circle station
img = Image.new('RGBA', (40, 40), (0, 0, 0, 0))
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
draw.ellipse([5, 5, 35, 35], fill=(150, 150, 190), outline=(100, 100, 140), width=2)
img.save('assets/sprites/station_circle.png')
```
